  ## Description

  This project uses `react`, `react-router-dom` and `react-semantic-ui` to build a single page application portfolio that showcases a developer's work samples. The application contains `react` components for a `Header`, `Navigation`, `Project` and `Footer` and uses mobile-first design. The application also has the following capabilities:

 * the user is presented with a page containing a header, a content section and a footer
 * the header displays the developer's name and a navigation bar
 * the navigation bar displays the following titles: About Me, Portfolio, Contact and Resume
 * the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted
 * clicking on a navigation title displays the corresponding page without the page reloading and the corresponding title is highlighted
 * the About Me title and section are selected by default when the portfolio is first loaded
 * the About Me section displays a recent photo or avatar of the developer and a short bio about them
 * the Portfolio section displays titled images of six of the developer's applications with links to the application's GitHub repository and deployment location
 * the Contact section displays a contact form with fields for a name, email address and message
 * moving the cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text displays a notification that this field is required
 * entering text in the email address field displays a notification if an invalid email address was entered
 * the Resume section displays a link to a downloadable resume and a list of the developer's proficiencies
 * the footer displays text or icon links to the developer's GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile on a third platform
